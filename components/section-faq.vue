    ### How may I find out what is on my record?

    The Missouri Highway Patrol provides an online record search request site: [Missouri Records Check](https://www.machs.mshp.dps.mo.gov/MocchWebInterface/pidSearch.html)
    The MHP report may not include all records.
    It may be necessary to search for case files using Missouri Case.Net:(need a link here--the one I found online times out).
    The UMKC Law School program is using the REJIS system to search for cases not found on Missouri Case.net.
