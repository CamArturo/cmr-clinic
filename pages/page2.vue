    <p>In Missouri a felony can be removed if it is at least seven years since sentence was completed and three years for a
      misdemeanor.
      A sentence is completed when you are done with probation and any community service time.</p>

    <p>The expungement must be filed in the court where the conviction was entered.</p>

    <p>On the next page we will ask some questions to see if your convictions can be removed.</p>
