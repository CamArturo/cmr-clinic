# Developer Notes

## Architechture
   
### Front End
   This is a [Nuxt/VueJS](https://nuxtjs.org/) Framework.
   To store data [VueX](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) is being used for local storage.
   
### Back End
   No backend has been developed.  
   There was discussion that it would be a singel page app without a backend to
   storing all criminal records in a backend. 

## Developer Setup

To setup Bootstrap to compile I used https://gist.github.com/benmccallum/33ff008660218a578fc27fd33f51d1c1

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Packages used
Added https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nuxtjs/markdownit for markdown support.

## Issue with using browser arrow keys.

VueX will not remember the data store if you use the browser arrow keys.
This is especaly true if you leave the single page app.  To demonstrate this:

1. Open a input page
2. Fill in some fields
3. Navigate using the Previous or Next page buttons
4. Naviagte back to to the page you fill in the fields using the Previous or Next page buttons
5. You will see values in the fields.
6. Close the window
7. Open the same input page as in step 1
8. There is no data in the fields.

The way to get around this is to use localstorage or cookies with the following
[GitHub - robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate: Persist and rehydrate your Vuex state between page reloads.](https://github.com/robinvdvleuten/vuex-persistedstate)

### Installing and Config


``````
npm install vuex-persistedstate
npm install js-cookie
``````

In Store/index.js

```
import createPersistedState from 'vuex-persistedstate';
import Cookies from "js-cookie";

Vue.use(Vuex)

const store = () => new Vuex.Store({
    plugins: [ createPersistedState({
        namespace: 'cmr-app',
        initialState: {},
        expires: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
        storage: {
            getItem: key => Cookies.get(key),
            setItem: (key, value) => Cookies.set(key, value),
            removeItem: key => Cookies.remove(key)
        }
    }) ],
    state: {
        todos: [],

```
